# Machine-Learning
The best small project to start with on a new tool is the classification of iris flowers using the iris dataset. This is a good machine  project because it is so well understood.  Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data. It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm. It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling. It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page). All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
